# Tic_Tac_Toe
The program initiates by extending a warm welcome to the user for a game of tic-tac-toe. Following the welcome message, the user is prompted to choose the type of match they wish to play. If the user inputs '1,' a Player vs. Player match begins, while '2' triggers a Player vs. Computer match.

************************************************Player vs. Player:************************************************
- Player 1 commences the game, taking the first turn and representing "X."
- Player 2 follows, taking the second turn and representing "O."
- Sequentially, each player is prompted to input an index between [1-9], corresponding to the game board's layout.
- The game board displays indices from 1 to 9, updating after each move.
- The game proceeds in this order until either a player wins or the game ends in a draw when all indices are filled, and none meet the winning conditions.

**Player vs. Computer:**
- In this mode, the player takes the initial turn, representing "X," followed by the computer representing "O."
- Player moves mirror those in the Player vs. Player match, with input requested for an index between [1-9].
- After the player's turn, the computer strategically selects its move for optimal gameplay.
- The game board updates after each move.
- Winning, losing, and draw conditions align with those in the "Player vs. Player" game.

Both game modes offer an engaging tic-tac-toe experience, with the Player vs. Computer mode incorporating an optimal strategy for the computer's moves.
